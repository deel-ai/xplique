    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        The model from which we want to obtain explanations
    batch_size
        Number of pertubed samples to explain at once.
        Default to 32.
    nb_samples
        Number of masks generated for Monte Carlo sampling.
    grid_size
        Size of the grid used to generate the scaled-down masks. Masks are then rescale to
        and cropped to input_size.
    preservation_probability
        Probability of preservation for each pixel (or the percentage of non-masked pixels in
        each masks), also the expectation value of the mask.

        Compute RISE for a batch of samples.

        Parameters
        ----------
        inputs
            Dataset, Tensor or Array. Input samples to be explained.
            If Dataset, targets should not be provided (included in Dataset).
            Expected shape among (N, W), (N, T, W), (N, W, H, C).
            More information in the documentation.
        targets
            Tensor or Array. One-hot encoding of the model's output from which an explanation
            is desired. One encoding per input and only one output at a time. Therefore,
