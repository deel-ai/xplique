    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        The model from which we want to obtain explanations
    batch_size
        Number of pertubed samples to explain at once.
        Default to 32.
    operator
        Function g to explain, g take 3 parameters (f, x, y) and should return a scalar,
        with f the model, x the inputs and y the targets. If None, use the standard
        operator g(f, x, y) = f(x)[y].
    nb_samples
        Number of masks generated for Monte Carlo sampling.
    grid_size
        Size of the grid used to generate the scaled-down masks. Masks are then rescale to
        and cropped to input_size. Can be a tuple for different cutting depending on the dimension.
        Ignored for tabular data.
    preservation_probability
        Probability of preservation for each pixel (or the percentage of non-masked pixels in
        each masks), also the expectation value of the mask.
    mask_value
        Value used as when applying masks.

        Parameters
        ----------
        inputs

        targets
            Tensor or Array. One-hot encoding of the model's output from which an explanation
