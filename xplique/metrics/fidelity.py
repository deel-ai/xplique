    """
    Used to compute the fidelity correlation metric. This metric ensure there is a correlation
    between a random subset of pixels and their attribution score. For each random subset
    created, we set the pixels of the subset at a baseline state and obtain the prediction score.
    This metric measures the correlation between the drop in the score and the importance of the
    explanation.

    Notes
    -----
    As noted in the original article, the default operation selects pixel-wise subsets
    independently. However, when using medium or high dimensional images, it is recommended to
    select super-pixels, see the grid_size parameter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        Model used for computing metric.
    inputs
        Input samples under study.
    targets
        One-hot encoded labels or regression target (e.g {+1, -1}), one for each sample.
    batch_size
        Number of samples to explain at once, if None compute all at once.
    grid_size
        If none, compute the original metric, else cut the image in (grid_size, grid_size) and
        each element of the subset will be a super pixel representing one element of the grid.
        You should use this when dealing with medium / large size images.
    subset_percent
        Percent of the image that will be set to baseline.
    baseline_mode
        Value of the baseline state, will be called with the a single input if it is a function.
    nb_samples
        Number of different subsets to try on each input to measure the correlation.
    operator
        Function g to explain, g take 3 parameters (f, x, y) and should return a scalar,
        with f the model, x the inputs and y the targets. If None, use the standard
        operator g(f, x, y) = f(x)[y].
    activation
        A string that belongs to [None, 'sigmoid', 'softmax']. Specify if we should add
        an activation layer once the model has been called. It is useful, for instance
        if you want to measure a 'drop of probability' by adding a sigmoid or softmax
        after getting your logits. If None does not add a layer to your model.

    The insertion metric, on the other hand, captures the importance of the pixels in terms of
    their ability to synthesize an image and is measured by the rise in the probability of the
    class of interest as pixels are added according to the generated importance map.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        Model used for computing metric.
    inputs
        Input samples under study.
    targets
        One-hot encoded labels or regression target (e.g {+1, -1}), one for each sample.
    batch_size
        Number of samples to explain at once, if None compute all at once.
    baseline_mode
        Value of the baseline state, will be called with the inputs if it is a function.
    steps
        Number of steps between the start and the end state.
        Can be set to -1 for all possible steps to be computed.
    max_percentage_perturbed
        Maximum percentage of the input perturbed.
    operator
        Function g to explain, g take 3 parameters (f, x, y) and should return a scalar,
