    """
    Base class for prototypes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cases_dataset
        The dataset used to train the model, examples are extracted from the dataset.
        `tf.data.Dataset` are assumed to be batched as tensorflow provide no method to verify it.
        Be careful, `tf.data.Dataset` are often reshuffled at each iteration, be sure that it is not
        the case for your dataset, otherwise, examples will not make sense.
    labels_dataset
        Labels associated to the examples in the dataset. Indices should match with cases_dataset.
        `tf.data.Dataset` are assumed to be batched as tensorflow provide no method to verify it.
        Batch size and cardinality of other dataset should match `cases_dataset`.
        Be careful, `tf.data.Dataset` are often reshuffled at each iteration, be sure that it is not
        the case for your dataset, otherwise, examples will not make sense.
    targets_dataset
        Targets associated to the cases_dataset for dataset projection. See `projection` for detail.
        `tf.data.Dataset` are assumed to be batched as tensorflow provide no method to verify it.
        Batch size and cardinality of other dataset should match `cases_dataset`.
        Be careful, `tf.data.Dataset` are often reshuffled at each iteration, be sure that it is not
        the case for your dataset, otherwise, examples will not make sense.
    k
        The number of examples to retrieve.
    projection
        Projection or Callable that project samples from the input space to the search space.
        The search space should be a space where distance make sense for the model.
        It should not be `None`, otherwise,
        all examples could be computed only with the `search_method`.

        Example of Callable:
        ```
        def custom_projection(inputs: tf.Tensor, np.ndarray, targets: tf.Tensor, np.ndarray = None):
            '''
            Example of projection,
            inputs are the elements to project.
            targets are optional parameters to orientated the projection.
            '''
            projected_inputs = # do some magic on inputs, it should use the model.
            return projected_inputs
        ```
    case_returns
        String or list of string with the elements to return in `self.explain()`.
        See `self.set_returns()` for detail.
    batch_size
        Number of sample treated simultaneously for projection and search.
        Ignored if `tf.data.Dataset` are provided (those are supposed to be batched).
    distance
        Distance for the knn search method.
        Either a Callable, or a value supported by `tf.norm` `ord` parameter.
        Their documentation (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/norm) say:
        "Supported values are 'fro', 'euclidean', 1, 2, np.inf and any positive real number
        yielding the corresponding p-norm." We also added 'cosine'.
