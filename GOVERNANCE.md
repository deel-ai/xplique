# Governance

`Xplique` is developed within the framework of the Toulouse Institute of Artificial and Natural Intelligence (DEEL/ANITI).
DEEL / ANITI is the owner of this repository and the manager of the writing rights.

These management rules are meant to be collaborative and all people involved in the project are invited to contribute to its improvement.

## Functions

### Governance committee

The governance committee is initially composed of the DEEL members who contributed to the first version of `Xplique` and are the only contributors to the master branch.

The members of the governance committee are

    - Thomas FEL
    - Lucas HERVIER
    - Antonin POCHE
    - David VIGOUROUX
    - Justin PLAKOO

The governance committee is responsible for the master branch, which contains the code for the version of the library that is officially recognized.
These governance committee members are the only ones who can merge pull requests from the contributing branches into this branch.

The governance committee identifies among the contributors those who by their merits can join the committee.

### Contributors

A contributor is anyone who comments on any aspect of the project: comments on an issue or pull request, documentation, architecture, code and validation tests or anyone who has a merged pull request.

All members of the governance committee are contributors.

### Maintainers

All contributors with write rights (commit rights) are maintainers.

### Contributions

The contribution rules are defined and developed in the CONTRIBUTING document.
Contributions are submitted on the dedicated `develop` or `master branch.

Pull requests with major changes must be approved by at least two members of the governance committee.
Pull requests with minor changes must be approved by at least one member of the Governance Committee.
