!!!note
    The paper referenced here is not exactly the one we implemented as we use a "naive" version of it. However, it is probably the closest in essence of what we implemented.

We define here a "naive" counterfactual method that is based on the Nearest Unlike Neighbor (NUN) concept introduced by Dasarathy in 1991[^1]. In essence, the NUN of a sample $(x, y)$ is the closest sample in the training dataset which has a different label than $y$.

Thus, in this naive approach to counterfactuals, we yield the $k$ nearest training instances that have a different label than the target of the input sample in a greedy fashion. 

As it is mentioned in the [API documentation](../../api_example_based/), by setting a `Projection` object, one will map the inputs to a space where the distance function is meaningful.

## Example

```python
from xplique.example_based import NaiveCounterFactuals

# load the training dataset
cases_dataset = ... # load the training dataset
targets_dataset = ... # load the one-hot encoding of predicted labels of the training dataset

# parameters
k = 5
distance = "euclidean"

# instantiate the NaiveCounterfactuals object
ncf = NaiveCounterFactuals(cases_dataset=cases_dataset,
                           targets_dataset=targets_dataset,
                           k=k,
                           distance=distance,
                          )

# load the test samples and targets
test_samples = ... # load the test samples to search for
test_targets = ... # load the one-hot encoding of the test samples' predictions

# search the CFs for the test samples
counterfactuals = ncf.explain(test_samples, test_targets)
```
