# Deletion

The Deletion Fidelity metric measures how well a saliency-mapâ€“based explanation of an image classification result localizes
the important pixels.

!!! quote
    The deletion metric measures the drop in the probability of a class as important pixels (given
    by the saliency map) are gradually removed from the image. A sharp drop, and thus a small
    area under the probability curve, are indicative of a good explanation.

The better the method, the smaller the score.

## Example

```python
from xplique.metrics import Deletion
from xplique.attributions import Saliency

# load images, targets and model
# ...
explainer = Saliency(model)
explanations = explainer(inputs, targets)

metric = Deletion(model, inputs, targets)
score = metric.evaluate(explanations)
```
